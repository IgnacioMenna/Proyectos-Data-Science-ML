## Walmart Store Sales

The Walmart Store Sales Forecasting challenge on Kaggle requires predicting weekly sales for each department. The data includes historical sales, store details, and features like fuel prices, CPI, and promotions. Major holidays have higher weight, making feature engineering important. The goal is to build a model that predicts sales for the test set in a CSV submission.
